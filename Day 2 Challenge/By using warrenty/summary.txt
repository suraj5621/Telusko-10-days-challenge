
I define a Java class called Product. This class represents a product that can be sold in a store. The class has the following properties:

name: The name of the product.
type: The type of product.
place: The location of the product.
warranty: The warranty period for the product.
The class also has the following methods:

addProduct(): Adds a product to the store.
getAllProducts(): Gets a list of all products in the store.
getProduct(): Gets a product by its warranty period.
getProductWithText(): Gets a list of products that contain a certain text in their name, type, or place.
The Main class creates a Service object and then uses it to add some products to the store. The Main class then prints out a list of all 
products, gets a product by its warranty period, and gets a list of products that contain the text "black" in their name, type, or
 place.
